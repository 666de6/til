# TIL
> Today I Learned
Taking notes of new things I've learned everyday. I bet we all have the same experience, it takes a long time to figure out something we really confused, but a couple of months(even days) later, we totally forgot when we wanna use. I start trying to write these down, so that I can look up if I forgot.
