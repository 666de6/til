# TIL
> Today I Learned
Taking notes of new things I've learned everyday. I bet we all have the same experience, it takes a long time to figure out something we really confused, but a couple of months(even days) later, we totally forgot when we wanna use. I start trying to write these down, so that I can look up if I forgot. 

_1 TILs and counting..._

- [How to customize a 1800mini keyboard](keyboard/1800mini.md)

## Usage
To auto-generate the README.md file, you can run
    ./createReadme.py > README.md
If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -
The `.vimrc` file for this project contains a function `CountTILs` that can
be invoked with `<leader>c`. This will do a substitution count of the
current number of TILs and display the result in the command tray.
## About
I shamelessly stole this idea from
