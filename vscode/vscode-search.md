# Day 21 - search in vscode

* `shift + cmd + f` -> global search in vscode
* `cmd + up/down` -> move up/down in search bar
* `shift + cmd + j` -> show/switch details inputs in search bar(such as "files to include/exclude")

* `cmd + t` -> search symbol(such as variables and functions) in workspace
* `shift + cmd + o` -> search symbol in current file, it'll list all symbols by default, including variables, functions etc. If you add a `:`, it'll list group by category.
* `shift + cmd + p` -> search commands in vscode
* `cmd + p` -> files navigation
* `ctrl + tab` -> switch between files
