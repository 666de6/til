# Statically typed programming languages' type system
We generally divided into 3 categories:

## Simple type system
This is the most basic type system, which can ensure type safety, but it is somewhat rigid. It doesn't allow you pass a dynamic type as a parameter.

## Type system that supports generics
Declare the changed type as a generic when declaring, and then determine the type when it's called. It's more flexible.

## Type system that supports type programming
You can do logical operations(such as loop and conditions) on type to get a new one. 

**By the way, TS type system is the last one. And you can do whatever you want by programming type, pretty muck like what we do in JS.**
