# Day 23 - shortcut-minded
The key is whatever operations/actions you do, if you do it frequently, you have to consider to do it by shortcuts. 
Sometimes it's definitely important to keep this in mind. As an engineer, we are always better at simplifying things, and focus more on doing things efficiently as well. I also believe this kind of mindset can be utilized to everything actually.

Here are some examples:
* `cmd + b` -> show/hide file explorer
* `cmd + l cmd + o` -> start live server
* `cmd + l cmd + c` -> stop live server
* `cmd + k + v` -> preview markdown files
* `cmd + shift + x` -> show extensions
* `cmd + k + r` -> reveal current file in finder
* `cmd + k + p` -> copy the absolute path
