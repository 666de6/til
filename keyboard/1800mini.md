# How to customize a 1800mini keyboard
Today I learned how to customize a keyboard(1800mini). After putting on all beautiful switches and keycaps, you need to do these things to make it work:

* Going to this website (https://ydkb.io/) to build your keyboard config, there is a keymap builder out there, you can set up as you wish. You can set different layer as well. It's like you can config one key with two or three action even. In the first layer, it might be "A", but in the second layer, it might be "esc" or whatever. 
* After finishing config, you should download this config file(XXX.bin file)
* Reflash Firmware:
  * Press and hold the top-left key(generally ESC), insert the USB cable. The OS shows a disk drive named "**1800MINI**" and the key can be released now.
  * **Win**: Drag the downloaded "1800MINI.BIN" into the disk to **just overwrite the original file(important)**. Then eject the disk or press Esc once to exit.
  * **Mac**: : You need to **completely delete**(after deleting the file, go to the trash and delete again) "1800MINI.BIN" before copying it into the disk.   
* Press `lShift` + `rShift` + `lCtrl` + `R` to turn on the bluetooth, then you can find it in your PC. 
* Have fun!
