# Algorithm Challenge

As a frontend developer, a algorithm rookie, I set this challenge for myself. Here are details below: 
* Learn one episode of my online course
* `Do practice`(at least 1) on leetcode
* `Write down a solution` and leave the comment on leetcode
* Leave the solution link below the `active GitHub issue` on time（within 48h）
